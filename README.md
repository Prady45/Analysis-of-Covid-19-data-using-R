# Using-R-to-analyze-Covid-19-Data

We have data for about 1,000 cases of COVID-19, which contains features like the age of each infected person, the gender, whether they recovered or died, among many other things. Through this project, I analysed whether the media claims that that older people are more likely to die than younger people from COVID-19 are true or not. Additionally, I also checked if the death rate is similar for men and women, or significantly different.
